 o chmod to also copy file permissions
 o ipv6 compatibility
 o temporary upload filename. rename afterwards
 o smart resuming (compare last bytes of the file)
 o better ascii mode transfer (resume etc)
 o scripting support
 o HTTP/1.1 PUT / WebDAV

Specific Tasks:
# add a --no-tls option
# some error-messages are given twice or even more times in different
  code-levels. check them and remove unneccessary ones.
