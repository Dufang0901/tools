.SH "NAME"
wdel \- A wget\-like program for deleting files on ftp servers
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
wdel [\fIoption\fR]... [\fI\s-1URL\s0\fR [\fI\s-1file\s0\fR]...]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Wdel is a free utility that is able to delete files on an ftp server.
.PP
Wdel is non\-interactive and background-capable. It can delete files or whole
directories and is meant to be a robust client even for unstable connections
and will therefore retry to delete a file, if the connection broke.
.PP
Wdel supports connections through proxies, allowing you to use it in an
environment that can access the internet only via a proxy or to provide
anonymity by hiding your ip\-address to the server.
For SOCKSv5\-proxies Wdel supports also listening mode, allowing you to use
port-mode ftp through a proxy (useful if the remote ftp is behind a firewall
or a gateway).
.SH "URL\-Input\-Handling"
URLs are recognized by the ftp://\-prefix.
.PP
Wdel first reads the URLs from the command line, and associates every file
with the last URL until a new URL is found (note that this is different
from wput). Then, it reads the \-\-input\-file (if any) and parses the URLs
in the same way.  So you can specify e.g. one URL and read all filenames
from a file.
.PP
If there are no explicit filenames given for a singe URL, then the last
part of the URL is taken to be the file/directory to be deleted. If there
are filenames, then the last part of the URL is considered to be the
directory where these files reside in. Slashes at the end of the URL or the
filename (in case it is a directory to be deleted) are ignored.

.IP "\fB\-V\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
.PD
Display the version of wdel.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR" 4

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
.PD
Print a help screen, with a short description of wdel's command-line options.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-background\fR" 4
.IX Item "--background"
.PD
Go to background immediately after startup.  If no output file is given,
wdel will redirect its output to "./wdel-log"
.Sh "Logging and Input File Options"
.IX Subsection "Logging and Input File Options"
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIlogfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o logfile"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-output\-file=\fR\fIlogfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--output-file=logfile"
.PD
Log all messages to \fIlogfile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR \fIlogfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a logfile"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-append\-output=\fR\fIlogfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--append-output=logfile"
.PD
Append all logged messages to \fIlogfile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-quiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "--quiet"
.PD
Turn off Wdel's output.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "--verbose"
.PD
Turn on verbose output. This gives some more information about what Wdel
does. If you specify this flag twice, you get debug output.
.IP "\fB\-nv\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nv"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-less\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "--less-verbose"
.PD
Be less verbose. That means reducing Wdel's output to a minimun. Specifying
this flag more often is equal to the --quiet flag.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i file"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-input\-file=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--input-file=file"
.PD
Reads URLs and filenames from \fIfile\fR. These will be added to the queue
just like if they were supplied via the command line.  See also the
URL-Input-Handling section.
.PD
If \fIfile\fR is \-, the URLs will be read from stdin.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-sort\fR" 4
.IX Item "--sort"
.PD
If sorting is enabled Wdel first reads all URLs from any input-devices available
and will sort them before deleting each file.
.PD
The sorting order is: ip/hostname, port, username, password, directory, filename.
Sorting requires a bit more memory since all data needs to be held there.
.IP "\fB\-\-basename=\fR\fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "--basename=path"
.PD
This option causes Wdel to snip \fIpath\fR from all filenames when they are
connected to the URL. wdel ftp://host/ /usr/share/doc.tgz would delete
ftp://host//usr/share/doc.tgz, whereas specifing /usr/share/ as basename will
result in ftp://host/doc.tgz being deleted.
.Sh "Connection Options"
.IX Subsection "Connection Options"
.IP "\fB\-\-bind\-address=\fR\fI\s-1ADDRESS\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--bind-address=ADDRESS"
When making client \s-1TCP/IP\s0 connections, \f(CW\*(C`bind()\*(C'\fR to \fI\s-1ADDRESS\s0\fR on
the local machine.  \fI\s-1ADDRESS\s0\fR may be specified as a hostname or \s-1IP\s0
address.  This option can be useful if your machine is bound to multiple
IPs.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR \fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t number"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-tries=\fR\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "--tries=number"
.PD
Set number of retries to \fInumber\fR.  Specify -1 for infinite retrying,
which is default, too.
.IP "\fB\-Y\fR \fIMODE\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Y MODE"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-proxy=\fR\fIMODE\fR" 4
.IX Item "--proxy=MODE"
.PD
MODE can be either \fIhttp\fR for http-based proxies (such as SQUID),
\fIsocks\fR for SOCKSv5 proxies or \fIoff\fR to disable the proxy.
.IP "\fB\-\-proxy-user=\fR\fINAME\fR" 4
.IX Item "--proxy-user=NAME"
If the proxy\-server requires authentication, use \fINAME\fR as user-name.
You need to specify \-\-proxy-pass too. These information can also be
stored in the wputrc\-file.
.IP "\fB\-\-proxy-pass=\fR\fIPASS\fR" 4
.IX Item "--proxy-pass=PASS"
Specifies the password to use for the proxy.
.Sh "FTP Options"
.IX Subsection "FTP Options"
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-port\-mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "--port-mode"
Per default, Wdel uses passive mode ftp, which works well for most
configurations. If passive mode fails, Wdel automatically falls back to
port mode.
.PD
If you want Wdel to start using port mode ftp, specify this flag.
.IP "\fB\-\-force-tls\fR" 4
.IX Item "--force-tls"
If this flag is specified and Wdel is linked with the OpenSSL-library, the flag
enforces the usage of TLS: If no TLS\-connection can be established the process
will cancel and not try to go on with an unencrypted connection.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Normally, the exit status is 0 if either everything went fine or there was
nothing to do.  If some files were skipped the exit status is set to 1. If
some files failed to be deleted due to a remote error, exit status is 2.
If some files failed and some others were skipped, exit status is 3. For
general problems like failure of some system-functions the exit status is
4.
.SH BUGS
.IX Header "BUGS"
.PD
You are welcome to send bug reports and suggestions about Wdel through the Sourceforge Bugtracking System:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=141519
.PP 0
Please send all available information that might concern this bug (e.g.
Operating System and what can be done to reproduce the error). Supply also
the debug-output (but remove confidential data if any), which helps a lot
analysing the problem. If you use a wputrc file, it might also be useful
to provide the relevant parts of it.
.PP 0
If there is a crash due to a segfault or similar, try to run it in a debugger, 
e.g. \f(CW\*(C`gdb `which wdel` core\*(C'\fR and type \f(CW\*(C`where\*(C'\fR
to get the backtrace. It would also be great help if you could recompile wdel
with memory-debugging support (make clean; make memdbg; [make install]) and use
this debug-dump.
